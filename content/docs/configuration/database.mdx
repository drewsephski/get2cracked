This template uses **Neon** as its recommended database solution. Neon offers a generous free tier for development and testing. You can find more information on their [pricing page](https://neon.tech/pricing).

## Steps

<Steps>

### Create Neon account

If you don't have a Neon account, follow their simple steps [here](https://neon.tech/docs/get-started-with-neon/signing-up) to create one.

### Copy database url

After creating a project on Neon, navigate to the "Connection Details" section. Select `Prisma` from the dropdown, then go to the `env` tab to find your `DATABASE_URL`.

<Callout type="warning">
  <b>Don't forget</b> to reveal the information hidden behind the stars using the eye icon to get the full connection string.
</Callout>

Paste in your `.env` file.

```js
DATABASE_URL = "postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname";
```

### Push migrations

You can push the migrations on your database with the cli.

```bash
npx prisma db push
```
