Your Get Cracked Starter SaaS template includes a powerful blog functionality that allows for rich content with multiple categories, authors, and related posts. This guide will walk you through setting up and configuring these features.

## Authors

### Adding a New Author

Blog posts can be attributed to **one or multiple authors**. To add a new author to your blog, simply add a new object to the `BLOG_AUTHORS` configuration in [`config/blog.ts`](config/blog.ts). Each author object should include a `name`, `image` URL, and a social handle (e.g., `instagram` or `twitter`).

```ts title="config/blog.ts" {7-11}
export const BLOG_AUTHORS = {
  drewsepeczi: {
    name: "drew sepeczi",
    image: "/_static/avatars/mickasmt.png",
    instagram: "drew.sepeczi",
  },
  newauthor: {
    name: "shadcn",
    image: "/_static/avatars/shadcn.jpeg",
    twitter: "shadcn",
  },
};
```

### Assigning Authors to a Blog Post

Once an author is defined, you can assign them to a blog post by referencing their key in the `authors` array within the post's frontmatter (e.g., `content/blog/your-post.mdx`).

```mdx {6-8}

```

## Categories

### Creating a New Category

To organize your blog posts, you can create custom categories. Add a new object with a `title`, `slug`, and `description` to the `BLOG_CATEGORIES` array in [`config/blog.ts`](config/blog.ts). Ensure the `slug` is unique and descriptive.

```ts title="config/blog.ts" {3,6-10}
export const BLOG_CATEGORIES: {
  title: string;
  slug: "news" | "education";
  description: string;
}[] = [
  {
    title: "News",
    slug: "news",
    description: "Updates and announcements for your blog.",
  },
  {
    title: "Education",
    slug: "education",
    description: "Educational content related to your SaaS product.",
  },
];
```

### Assigning Categories to a Blog Post

Assign categories to your blog posts by listing their `slug` in the `categories` array within the post's frontmatter.

```mdx {9-10}

---
```

<Callout type="warning">
  A blog post can belong to multiple categories, but currently, only the first
  category in the list is displayed in the UI.
</Callout>

## Related Posts

Each blog post can feature a list of related posts to encourage further reading. To link related posts, use their filenames (without the `.mdx` or `.md` extension) in the `related` array within the post's frontmatter.

```mdx {11-13}
